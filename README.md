# TrustShare — Secure File-Sharing System

TrustShare is a secure file-sharing platform that allows users to upload, store, and share files safely through encrypted access mechanisms. It supports secure file uploads, server-side AES-256 encrypted storage, controlled sharing permissions, temporary access links, download tracking, audit logging, and authentication-based access control.

Built for organizations, educational institutions, businesses, secure document exchange, and enterprise collaboration.

## Objective

Build a secure file-sharing and document management platform with the following outcomes:

- Authentication and role-based access control
- Secure file upload and encrypted storage workflows
- Secure sharing and temporary access management
- File activity monitoring and audit logging
- Notification and security alert systems
- Analytics dashboards for storage usage and activity monitoring
- Server-side AES-256 encryption and secure key management
- Deployment via Docker on AWS/Azure

---

## Architecture

**High-level layers:**

- **Client Applications:** Web App (React/Next.js), Mobile App, Desktop Client, Admin Dashboard
- **Secure API Gateway:** SSL termination, authentication/authorization, request validation, rate limiting, audit logging, routing
- **Backend Services (FastAPI):** Auth Service, File Service, Encryption Service, Sharing Service, Notification Service, Analytics Service
- **Message Queue / Event Bus:** RabbitMQ / Kafka — async tasks, events, notifications
- **Data Storage Layer:** PostgreSQL (users, metadata, permissions), MongoDB (file metadata, activity logs), Redis (cache, sessions, tokens), Encrypted File Storage (AWS S3 / Azure Blob), Audit Logs DB
- **External Services:** Email (SendGrid), Push Notifications (FCM), CAPTCHA/Anti-bot (Cloudflare)
- **Monitoring & Security:** SIEM, IDS/IPS, alert engine, audit & compliance reports, ML-based anomaly detection
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, NGINX, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), AWS/Azure, Prometheus + Grafana

### Encryption Workflow (Server-Side Encryption)

1. User uploads a file via the web app over HTTPS.
2. FastAPI validates file type, size, and permissions.
3. FastAPI generates a unique AES-256 encryption key for the file.
4. The file is encrypted on the server.
5. The encrypted file is stored in AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage.
6. File metadata and permissions are stored in PostgreSQL.
7. Activity logs are stored in MongoDB.
8. Authorized users request access via secure sharing links.
9. FastAPI decrypts the file temporarily in memory.
10. The decrypted file is securely delivered to the authorized user.

**Key Management**
- Unique encryption key per uploaded file
- Keys managed securely server-side only
- Keys are never exposed to users
- Periodic key rotation

## Getting Started

> Fill in these sections once initial setup is complete.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis (or run via Docker Compose)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/trustshare.git
cd trustshare

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with (example):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/trustshare
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/trustshare
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET_KEY=change-me
AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-me
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_S3_BUCKET=
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or run services individually
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # backend
npm run dev                     # frontend
```
